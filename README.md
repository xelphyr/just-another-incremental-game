# What is it
a game where you walk around to collect coins, then unlock and upgrade various tools (currently one) that collect or boost coins for you! The twist? They can hurt you.

- To upgrade stuff press the top-right 'Open Menu' button
- The green bar to the bottom-right represents your healthbar: when it reaches 0 you die. 
- The panel to the bottom-right shows how many coins you have

There isn't an end-goal or a proper gameplay loop currently, but all the systems are in place and it's trivial to add more tools.
